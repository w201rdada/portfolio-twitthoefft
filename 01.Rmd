## The L-VAD Heart Pump.

Individuals with serious heart failure are now being treated with an advanced medical technology known as a L-VAD, left-ventricle assist device.  This is essentially an implanted heart pump, designed to assist with the flow of blood through the body to compensate for a weak heart.  Patients with L-VADs and their health care providers are highly concerned about blood clots, which are a big risk for those with these pumps installed.  

To help control the risk of blood clots, patients are prescribed blood thinning drugs, such as Coumadin.  However, the specific dosage of Coumadin needs to be monitored and regulated very closely, as there are risks at both ends: blood that is too ‘thin’ will not clot effectively and can cause excessive bleeding; and blood that is too thick clots too easily and can impair the function of the L-VAD pump.  To determine the appropriate level, patients regularly receive a lab test known as the INR - International Normalized Ratio - which is a measure of the blood’s ability to clot.  

The doctors and nurses that monitor the INR score of their patients will recommend  dosage adjustments of the anticoagulant drugs to bring their patient’s INR into the desired range.  And this is where the data science problem lies - the dosage amount and corresponding change of INR value can be difficult to predict.  Different patients respond either very strongly or very weakly to different dosages, and with many patients to manage, making the best dosage recommendation is difficult to achieve.  

## INR Management System.

This problem will be approached in three primary ways: visualizing the INR trend, applying statistical process control to historical data, and third, the application of a prediction algorithm to recommend dosage changes to bring the INR metric back to the target value.  The current method of reviewing INR history is through digital medical records.  These records contain tabulated values - none of the data is visualized.  Trends could be missed or misdiagnosed due to the absence of a visual representation of the patient’s INR history.

Secondly, it’s important to consider the statistical variation of the INR score when determining whether to intervene and take action.  Over-compensating with a dosage change, when the fluctuation is actually caused by random variation, can cause further harm and risk worsening the patient’s status.  Time-series data analysis techniques such as statistical process control could be used to determine whether the INR reading is outside of normal variation and requires response.

Finally, a prediction algorithm will be created to make recommended dosage changes when the INR value falls outside of norms.  The goal is to bring the patient back to baseline with the fewest amount of adjustments and in the shortest period of time.  Because the INR value can lag several days after a Coumadin dose change, its important to bring the patient back to baseline quickly, to minimize the amount of time the INR is in a dangerous regime.  

## Better Outcomes.

With a systematic approach to monitoring patient’s INR scores, health care providers can better identify situations that require intervention and those that do not.  Furthermore, the prediction algorithm brings patient’s INR scores back into range much faster than before - thereby reducing the amount of time the patient is exposed to blood clot risk.
