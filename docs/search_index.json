Intro… Figure 2: Tim Witthoefft Intro Video Abstract of my first cool idea Heart failure patients and their healthcare providers closely monitor a critical blood-clotting lab test called INR - International Normalized Ratio. With this test result, Doctors presribe dosage changes to critical blood thinning drugs, such as Coumadin, that help to regulage the patients’ blood coagulation. Current methods for INR management either involve static protocols applied to all patients, or personally-learned yet undocumented tendencies gained by practitioners from the historical management of a patient over time. To help guide these critical decisions, the proposed data tool will visually plot INR scores over time, assess the statistical variation to detect outliers and abnormal signals, and offer predictive dossage recommendations that are tailored for the individual patient. With a systematic approach to monitoring patient’s INR scores, health care providers can better identify situations that require intervention and those that do not. Abstract of my second cool idea The manufacturing of semiconductor devices involves hundreds of individual chemical processes. With billions of transistors per chip and hundreds of chips per silicon wafer, there are many potential points of failure that can cause a chip to not work. When defects are found, the current methodology for all semiconductor companies is to classify defect images manually by trained technicians. This proposal suggests that recent advances in convolutional neural networks may provide an alternative solution to human classifiers that would speed up manufacturing, improve classification accuracy, and more quickly detect new defects. About the author Tim Witthoefft is a Senior Engineer at Samsung Austin Semiconductor and an 11 year veteran in the semiconductor industry. The deep learning defect image classification idea comes from his own work at Samsung and is a real, unsolved problem in the field. Tim’s wife, Sarah, is a Registered Nurse and specializes in heart failure and L-VAD heart pumps. The INR project idea comes from her work and the challenges seen by the Seton heart failure clinic in Austin. Updated: 2017-11-26 "],

With billions of transistors per chip and hundreds of chips per silicon wafer, there are many potential points of failure that can cause a chip to not work. Therefore, an integral part of the manufacturing process is defect inspection. Various techniques are used to identify where defects are located, but once a defect is found, an image of the defect is taken using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). These SEM images are highly useful for engineers trying to understand the underlying cause of the defect. The size, shape, and depth of the defect provide clues as to when and why the defect may have occurred. Defect images are also labeled with a classification name - such as sphere, scratch, and lifting defects. With every defect labeled, engineers can plot the occurrence rate of particular defects over time. The current methodology for all semiconductor companies is to classify defect images manually by trained technicians. A defect catalog of references images is used to match up every defect to one of about 150 predefined types. Figure 3: Wafer defect example Convolutional Neural Networks With recent advances in machine vision using neural networks, the time is right to try modern techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which have proven highly effective at image recognition. There are several key benefits that an algorithm-driven classification system would provide. First, image classification is usually the bottleneck step during the detection-inspection-classification process. Near-immediate classification would allow product material to continue to the next process step, rather than waiting for a technician to review the images. Secondly, classification accuracy may improve dramatically. Manually labeling images is a tedious and repetitive task, and by the end of a 12 hour shift, it’s common to make mistakes. Additionally, there may be pressures put upon technicians to meet manufacturing quotas, which could lead to rushed decisions and poorer accuracy. Finally, the predefined image classes are generally capped at 150 types not because that is the total count of possible failures, but rather because human classifiers cannot easily manage hundreds of different classes. A CNN algorithm could be used to cluster single classes into sub-groups, which may provide important new information. A Smarter Factory The application of CNNs for image classification could transform the semiconductor industry. While neural networks are often limited due to insufficient training data, semiconductor factories have millions of labeled reference images for model training. Faster, more accurate classification will provide new insights and enable tracing of defect sources. Though jobs will be replaced with an algorithm, the time and effort of skilled technicians can be redirected with retraining to more interesting and highly in-demand roles such as maintenance and process engineering.

INR Management System. Better Outcomes.", " Helping health care providers and heart failure patients {#Managing Blood Clot Risk} Keywords Heart failure, LVAD, blood clots, INR The L-VAD Heart Pump. Individuals with serious heart failure are now being treated with an advanced medical technology known as a L-VAD, left-ventricle assist device. The L-VAD is essentially an implanted heart pump, designed to assist with the flow of blood through the body to compensate for a weak heart. Though the health and function of patients greatly improves after implanting the L-VAD, their health care providers are highly concerned about the formation of blood clots, which are a big risk for those with these pumps installed. Figure 4: L-VAD device To help control the risk of blood clots, patients are prescribed blood thinning drugs, such as Coumadin. However, the specific dosage of Coumadin needs to be monitored and regulated very closely, as there are risks at both ends: blood that is too ‘thin’ will not clot effectively and can cause excessive bleeding; and blood that is too thick clots too easily and can impair the function of the L-VAD pump. To determine the appropriate level, patients regularly receive a lab test known as the INR - International Normalized Ratio - which is a measure of the blood’s ability to clot. Doctors and nurses monitor their patient’s INR scores several times per week and will recommend dosage adjustments of the anticoagulant drugs if their patient’s INR score is out of the desired range. And this is where the data science problem lies - the dosage adjustment and corresponding change of INR value can be difficult to predict. Each patient is unique and responds differently to dosage changes. A standardized and conservative protocol is consistent, but not tailored for each patient specifically. Alternatively, trial-and-error experience can teach nurses how a particular patient will react, so that customized recommendations can be made in the future; but this kind of learning is not systematic and is dependent on that nurse’s “tribal knowledge”. With many patients for a single clinic to manage, making the best dosage recommendation is difficult to achieve. INR Management System. Figure 5: INR blood test This problem will be approached in three primary ways: visualizing the INR trend, applying statistical process control to historical data, and creating a prediction algorithm to recommend dosage changes to bring the INR metric back to the target value. The current method of reviewing INR history is through digital medical records. These records contain tabulated values - none of the data is visualized. Trends could be missed or misdiagnosed due to the absence of a visual representation of the patient’s INR history. Secondly, it’s important to consider the statistical variation of the INR score when determining whether to intervene and take action. Over-compensating with a dosage change, when the fluctuation is actually caused by random variation, can cause further harm and risk worsening the patient’s status. Time-series data analysis techniques such as statistical process control could be used to determine whether the INR reading is outside of normal variation and requires response. Finally, a prediction algorithm will be created to make recommended dosage changes when the INR value falls outside of norms. The goal is to bring the patient back to baseline with the fewest amount of adjustments and in the shortest period of time. Because the INR value can lag several days after a Coumadin dose change, its important to bring the patient back to baseline quickly, to minimize the amount of time the INR is in a dangerous regime. With a systematic methodology in place, it may be possible to add additional variables to the algorithm, such as the patient’s current weight, diet choices, or other blood tests, further enhancing the accuracy and personalization of the algorithm. Better Outcomes. With a systematic approach to monitoring patient’s INR scores, health care providers can better identify situations that require intervention and those that do not. Furthermore, the prediction algorithm brings patient’s INR scores back into range much faster than before - thereby reducing the amount of time the patient is exposed to blood clot risk. "]
