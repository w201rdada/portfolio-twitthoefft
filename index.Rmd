### Abstract of my first cool idea

Heart failure patients and their healthcare providers closely monitor a critical blood-clotting lab test called INR - International Normalized Ratio.  With this test result, Doctors presribe dosage changes to critical blood thinning drugs, such as Coumadin, that help to regulage the patients' blood coagulation.  Current methods for INR management either involve static protocols applied to all patients, or personally-learned yet undocumented tendencies gained by practitioners from the historical management of a patient over time.  To help guide these critical decisions, the proposed data tool will visually plot INR scores over time, assess the statistical variation to detect outliers and abnormal signals, and offer predictive dossage recommendations that are tailored for the individual patient.  With a systematic approach to monitoring patientâ€™s INR scores, health care providers can better identify situations that require intervention and those that do not.
