### Abstract of my first cool idea

Heart failure patients and their healthcare providers closely monitor a critical blood-clotting lab test called INR - International Normalized Ratio.  With this test result, Doctors presribe dosage changes to critical blood thinning drugs, such as Coumadin, that help to regulage the patients' blood coagulation.  Current methods for INR management either involve static protocols applied to all patients, or personally-learned yet undocumented tendencies gained by practitioners from the historical management of a patient over time.  To help guide these critical decisions, the proposed data tool will visually plot INR scores over time, assess the statistical variation to detect outliers and abnormal signals, and offer predictive dossage recommendations that are tailored for the individual patient.  With a systematic approach to monitoring patientâ€™s INR scores, health care providers can better identify situations that require intervention and those that do not. 

### Abstract of my second cool idea

The manufacturing of semiconductor devices involves hundreds of individual chemical processes. With billions of transistors per chip and hundreds of chips per silicon wafer, there are many potential points of failure that can cause a chip to not work.  When defects are found, the current methodology for all semiconductor companies is to classify defect images manually by trained technicians.  This proposal suggests that recent advances in convolutional neural networks may provide an alternative solution to human classifiers that would speed up manufacturing, improve classification accuracy, and more quickly detect new defects.
